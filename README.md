## 2. Features
**dart_azure_ad_sign_in** allows Flutter and Dart apps to optain authentication tokens for authorized access to protected resources like Azure web APIs.
The package can simply be used without any configuration to gain the same access you would have with the **[az cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)**, or it can be configurated to modify the access.

## 3. Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant N as Dart/Flutter App
    participant S as Microsoft Sign-In page
    participant E as Microsoft token Endpoint
    Note over N,E: Sign-In Sequence
    N->>N: Opens local HTTP-Server
    S->>S: User signs-in
    S->>N: Sends code to local HTTP-Server
    N->>E: Sends code, redirect_uri, grant_type and client_id to the token endpoint
    E->>N: Returns access- and refresh-token
    N->>N: Closes local HTTP-Server
    Note over N,E: After token expires: Refresh-Token Sequence
    N->>E: Send grant_type and refresh_token to Azure token Endpoint
    E->>N: Returns a new access- and refresh-token
```


## 4. Getting started

### 4.1. Installation
Add the dependency to the pubspec.yaml for Dart and Flutter
```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_azure_ad_sign_in: ^1.0.0
```
Or Run this command with Dart:
```powershell
dart pub add dart_azure_ad_sign_in
```
With Flutter:
```powershell
flutter pub add dart_azure_ad_sign_in
```

### 4.2. Import
Import the package:
```dart
import 'package:dart_azure_ad_sign_in/dart_azure_ad_sign_in.dart';
```

### 4.3. Android Settings

#### 4.3.1. Networking
As this app uses internet, networking needs to be enabled in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android...>
  ...
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  <application ...
</manifest>
```

#### 4.3.1. Cleartext traffic
This app will open a local Http Server, which accepts cleartext traffic, allow an insecure connection to only the localhost by creating `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` and configure it as following.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">localhost</domain>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```
Then load the file into your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest ...>
    <application
        ...
        android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
        ...>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>

```

### 4.4. iOS Settings

## 5. Usage

### 5.1 AzureSignIn instance creation and configuration
The class itself is very flexible, no parameters need to be set and it will use the **[az cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)** configuration.
For information on all available variables in this class, refer to **5.5 AzureSignIn Variables**

#### 5.1.1. Creating instance without parameters (using az cli default settings)
```dart
    final azureSignIn = AzureSignIn();
```

#### 5.1.2. Creating instance with parameters
Parameters for the Authentication and local Http-Server can be set if needed.
```dart
  final azureSignIn = AzureSignIn(
    // The Application (client) ID that the Azure portal â€“ App registrations page assigned to your app.
    // Optional, uses the az cli client id: '04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46'
    clientId: '04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46',
    // A list of scopes that you want the user to consent to.
    // Optional, uses the az cli scope: ['https://management.core.windows.net//.default', 'offline_access', 'openid', 'profile']
    scope: [
      'https://management.core.windows.net//.default',
      'offline_access',
      'openid',
      'profile',
    ],
    // Port of the Local HttpServer which will receive the code after sign in.
    // Optional, uses the port 5000
    port: 5000,
    // Response of the Local HttpServer, which the user will see in the browser after successful sign in.
    // Optional, uses 'Sign In successful. This window can now be closed.'
    serverSuccessResponse: '<h1>Sign In successful.</h1><p>This window can now be closed.</p>',
    // Response of the Local HttpServer, which the user will see in the browser after sign in failure.
    // Optional, uses 'Sign In failed. Close this window and try again.'
    serverErrorResponse: '<h1>Sign In failed.</h1><p>Close this window and try again.</p>',
    // Duration on how long the local HttpServer waits, for the user to sign in before creating a cancelled-token and closing.
    // Optional, uses Duration(minutes: 5)
    signInTimeoutDuration: Duration(minutes: 5),
  );
```
### 5.2. Sign In

#### 5.2.1. Get the Sign Microsoft Sign-In page URL
The user needs to sign-in in the Browser, to do so the Sign In URL can be received.
If Flutter is being used, this URL could be opened with the **[url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher)**
```dart
    // Print the SignIn URL, the user has to open in the browser.
    print(azureSignIn.signInUri);
```

#### 5.2.2. Start the Sign In process
The signIn will return a new `Token`.
In the background a `HttpServer` is started and waits for the code to be received after the Sign In in the Browser, 
then the **Microsoft token Endpoint** will be called with the code and a token is returned.
The `Token` will always be created, but depending on success or error, different values will be set, see the variable `token.status` in **5.6 The Token-Entity**.
```dart
    Token token = await azureSignIn.signIn();
```

### 5.3. Cancel the Sign In process
The Sign In Process itself has the defined timeout set in the variable `azureSignIn.signInTimeoutDuration`, but with the following function the user could cancel the Sign in if needed.
The `azureSignIn.signIn()` will then receive a `Token` with the information of a cancellation in the variable `token.status` (See more: **5.6 The Token-Entity**).
```dart
    // Cancels the sign-in process.
    async azureSignIn.cancelSignIn();
```

### 5.4. Refresh Token
Once the token expires it can be either refreshed by giving it the existing `Token` or just giving it a refresh-token String.
On of the Values needs to be sent, else a `Token` with a error-status will be returned, see `token.status` in **5.6 The Token-Entity**.

#### 5.4.1. Refresh Token with a `Token`
The Token can be refreshed by using the existing `Token`
```dart
    // refresh a token by giving the previous aquired token object.
    token = await azureSignIn.refreshToken(token: token);
```

#### 5.4.1 Refresh Token with the Refresh-Token String
Or if the `Token` is not available anymore the refresh-token can be sent as a String.
```dart
    // refresh a token by giving the refresh-token as a string.
    token = await azureSignIn.refreshToken(refreshToken: refreshTokenString);
```
